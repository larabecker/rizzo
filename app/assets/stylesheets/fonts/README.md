# lp-fonts

Our collection of fonts (currently Freight Sans in two weights) in ttf, svg and woff formats.

These are included as a submodule directly in Rizzo. If you want to use the fonts in your project they will already be available for you within Rizzo. They are in this repository so that we can make Rizzo public without invalidating our license with the font foundry.
